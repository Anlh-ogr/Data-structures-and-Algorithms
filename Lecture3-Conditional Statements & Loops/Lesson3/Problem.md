# Summation Problem?

## Sum of the first N natural numbers?
### How to solve a problem:
1. Understand the problem.
   - Calculate the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to N.
   - Identify the input (N) and output (sum) requirements.
2. Find input.
   - Enter a number N.
3. Find solution.
   - Initialize variables to mark the start: `count = 1`, `sum = 0`.
4. Convert solution to code.
   - Use a programming language to implement the solution.
5. Optimization.
   - Use the formula for the sum of the first N natural numbers: 
   $$\text{sum} = \frac{n \cdot (n + 1)}{2}$$

### Pseudocode
1. Input `n`.
2. `count` = 1, `sum` = 0.
3. While `count` <= n
        `sum += count`
        `count += 1`
4. Print `sum`.
5. End.
